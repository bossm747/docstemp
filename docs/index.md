# Introduction

Welcome to the Innovate Hub Documentation Boiler Plate. This project is designed to streamline the development process, focusing on best practices, code quality, and documentation.

## Rebranding Process

As part of our continuous improvement efforts, we have rebranded the project from "python-project-template" to "Innovate Hub Documentation Boiler Plate". This rebranding reflects our commitment to innovation and providing a comprehensive documentation solution. The changes include updates to the project name, repository URL, and documentation structure to better align with our goals and vision.
